I am a Back end Developer with commercial experience in API, seeking an opportunity in an environment that will expand my knowledge and skills while enabling me to add value to the business using my existing technical strengths, analytical abilities and strong people skills.

I have had a fascination with software development since a young age and I keep up to date with current technologies. I am open to working with different technologies and to learning new skills.

<h2>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP SEPT-DEC 2017</h2>
I recently graduated from a highly selective, 16 week, intensive software development boot camp at Makers Academy. The last two weeks of the course was spent working on a group project of our choice.

From my experience at Makers Academy, I have expanded my existing knowledge of programming languages and it has sharpened my understanding of the importance of best practices and new methodologies such as TDD (Test Driven Development), Agile, OOD (Object Oriented Design) and Scrum.

<h2><a id="achievements">SELECTED ACHIEVEMENTS</a></h2>
<p>Designed and built an E-learning Aid to assist students studying Wi-Fi, WiMAX and LTE (Long Term Evolution). The E-learning Aid provided a “blended learning” experience which embraced a number of multimedia modes such as text, video, audio and Flash animations.

<p>Constructed an E-commerce music site similar to iTunes based on Oracle, JavaScript and PHP.  I worked in the Integrated Project Team as Oracle Database Designer.</p>

<p>I led a team to analyse a business system, identifying problems and coming up with our own solution. We evaluated our solution in terms of its effectiveness, efficiency and financial viability in comparison to the existing system for the company. This was later used in our project during Simulated Business Week.</p>

<p>As the programmer in an Integrated Project Team, we constructed a small-scale version of a solution from a previous system design project. The system used Access Database, OBDC and Java and the product was demonstrated to the public.</p>
