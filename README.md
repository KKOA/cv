I am a Backend Developer with commercial experience in API, seeking an opportunity in an environment that will expand my knowledge and skills while enabling me to add value to the business using my existing technical strengths, analytical abilities and strong people skills.

I have had a fascination with software development since a young age and I keep up to date with current technologies. I am open to working with different technologies and to learning new skills. 

<h2>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP SEPT-DEC 2017</h2>
I recently graduated from a highly selective, 16 week, intensive software development boot camp at Makers Academy. The last two weeks of the course was spent working on a group project of our choice. 

From my experience at Makers Academy, I have expanded my existing knowledge of programming languages and it has sharpened my understanding of the importance of best practices and new methodologies such as TDD (Test Driven Development), Agile, OOD (Object Oriented Design) and Scrum.
